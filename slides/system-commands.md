###  System commands

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> PHP can natively do a lot of common Unix operations: [`copy`](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.copy.php), [`chmod`](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php), [`chown`](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.chown.php), etc.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Can also execute arbitrary system operations!

Note:

* PHP has functions to do a lot of common operations, but can also execute arbitrary system commands
    - Can be both extremely helpful and extremely...dangerous.
