# Building for the PHP Command Line Interface

Executing PHP from the command line enables us to interact with our applications in new and interesting ways: from performing site maintenance to scaffolding new projects, CLI tools like [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/artisan), and [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/) make it easy to interface with our code without ever opening a browser.

Attendees will be introduced to popular PHP CLI tools and their default capabilities. We'll discuss characteristics of good CLI scripts, strong use-cases for writing custom commands, then write several CLI programs across different platforms.
